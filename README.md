This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Email sending

The idea right now is to use Amazon SES to send emails. You need to set the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables to your AWS credentials in order to use the app.

## OpenAI API key

You need to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to your OpenAI API key in order to use the app.

## Rate limiting

In order to cut expenses, there's a heavy rate limit on the ChatGPT related endpoints currently.
